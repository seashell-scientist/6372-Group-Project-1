```{r import}
#insert your movie database file here

mdata <- readxl::read_xlsx("./2014 and 2015 CSM dataset.xlsx")

#I haven't had time to go through it in detail yet

summarize(mdata$Gross) 

```


```{r inital visualizations}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = mdata, aes(x = Ratings, y = Gross))+
  geom_bin2d(bins = 20)+
  labs(title = "Movie Ratings VS Gross")
```

```{r vis2}
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data = mdata, aes(x = Screens, fill = I("yellow")), binwidth = 40)

ggplot(data = mdata, aes(x = Screens, y = Gross))+
  geom_line()
```


```{r vis3}
ggplot(data = mdata, aes(x = Budget, y = Gross, color = factor(Year)))+
  geom_line(linejoin = "round")
 
ggplot(data = mdata, aes(sample = Gross, color = Year))+
  geom_qq()

```


roughly positive correlation between gross and rating, screens obviously positively correlates with gross. 

the distribution isn't normal, lots of small presumably indie films that didn't make much gross or have many theater showings, and a few huge blockbusters
